# Hi, I'm Kevin 👋

## Consultant Turned Builder

I'm a Principal at BCG with 9+ years of strategy consulting experience, now building products that solve real problems using AI-assisted development platforms. I'm not a developer by training, but a developer by experience.

## What I'm Building

### 🌍 [WanderLuxe](https://github.com/reminiscent-io/wanderluxe)
A mobile-first travel itinerary platform born from my own frustrations with travel planning. Started in January 2025, this project evolved from desktop to mobile-first design through 200+ hours of hands-on development. Features real-time restaurant reservations and intelligent itinerary management.

**Stack:** React, Vite, Modern web technologies

### 💃 CPF Dance
A comprehensive platform for my wife's dance instruction business, featuring:
- Two-way communication between dancers and instructors
- AI-powered note-taking capabilities
- Scheduling and class management
- Integrated payments portal

## My Approach

I leverage AI-assisted coding platforms (particularly Replit) to rapidly translate product strategy and customer experience insights into working applications. My consulting background gives me a unique lens on user needs, while my hands-on development experience lets me ship real solutions.

## Background

- **Current Role:** Principal at Boston Consulting Group
- **Expertise:** Product strategy, customer experience, loyalty programs, customer economics
- **Development Focus:** Solving daily problems through practical, user-centered applications
